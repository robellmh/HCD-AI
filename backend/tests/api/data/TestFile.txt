1.3.1 AYH responsive health interventions
Recently it is recognized that the desired outcomes of AYH can be achieved by addressing both clinical and non-clinical aspects of the health system. This is a paradigm shift towards an adolescent and youth responsive health system. Such a health system is achieved when institutions and institutional relationships are designed in such a way that they can respond appropriately to the expectations of individuals. The availability of high standards for AYH services, responsive to the health needs of adolescents, is crucial.The elements of responsive adolescent and youth health are listed below.
Dignity: Awareness of the worth of each person as unique and endowed with various attributes and potential. A person’s dignity can be either damaged or enhanced through relationships with others
Autonomy: The right to make informed decisions by oneself
Confidentiality: The right of an individual to keep personal information private, including health-care records. This means that access to personal data and information is restricted to individuals who have a reason and permission for such access. The requirement to maintain confidentiality governs not only how data and information are collected (e.g. a private space for a consultation), but also how the data are stored (e.g. without names and other identifiers) and how, if at all, the data are shared.
Prompt attention:warm greetings, active listening, eye contact and empathy
Clean amenities:ensure the safety of medical instruments and materials used for client diagnosis and management
Access to social support networks during care: ensure that parents, guardians and other community members or organizations recognize the value of providing health service to dolescents and support their utilization by adolescents
Skilled Care Provider: the technical competence required to provide effective health services to adolescents. Both healthcare providers and support staff respect, protect and fulfill adolescents’ rights to information, privacy, confidentiality, non-discrimination, non-judgment and respect
Comfort:The HEW should assess comfort levels. HEWs need to show empathy while presenting information about AYH

1.3.2 Major challenges
Some of the major challenges in providing AYH services are as follows:
• Attitudes to specific services such as family planning and safe abortion care
• Adolescent and youth-related supply shortage
• Infrastructure problems
• Poor health-seeking behaviour of adolescents and youth
• Lack of leadership and management support at all levels

1.3.3 Positive attitude towards AYH
• Adolescents and youth need empathy (putting yourself in their shoes
• They need active listening and understanding
• Always use a non-judgmental approach while serving them
