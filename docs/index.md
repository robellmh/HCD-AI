# Welcome to **AI-for-HEWs** Documentation

This solution deploys a RAG-based service to support Health Extension Workers (HEWs) in Ethiopia. But it can easily
be configured to support other Community Health Workers (CHWs) in other countries.

There are two major use cases:

1. **Diagnosis**: Given a set of symptoms, the service will help you diagnose the disease and recommend treatments.
2. **Question Answering**: Answering questions related to health and diseases based only on documents uploaded.


## Architecture
